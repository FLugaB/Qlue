##Shell

1) Create a single line script that returns the number of httpd processes that are running on the current machine.
2) Open a terminal and type:
# cd /tmp
# mkdir -p mig33/inner.folder
# touch mig33/inner.folder/1.txt # nano mig33/inner.folder/1.txt # write “Green Mango Orange Mango”
From the current folder (/tmp), provide some bash commands that will change all the “Mango” words into “Apple” in 1.txt file.
